# Test for simply supported plate under uniform pressure

# One quarter of a 50 m x 50 m x 1m plate is modeled in this test.
# Pressure loading is applied on the top surface using nodal forces
# of magnitude -10 N on all nodes. This corresponds to a pressure (q) of
# -10.816 N/m^2.

# The FEM solution at (0,0), which is at the center of the full plate
# is -3.003319e-03 m (for a 5*5 mesh).

# The analytical solution for displacement at center of plate obtained
# using a thin plate assumption for a square plate is
# w = 16 q a^4/(D*pi^6) \sum_{m = 1,3,5, ..}^\inf \sum_{n = 1,3,5, ..}^\inf  (-1)^{(m+n-2)/2}/(mn*(m^2+n^2)^2)

# The above solution is the Naviers series solution from the "Theory of plates
# and shells" by Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger (1959).

# where a = 50 m, q = -10.816 N/m^2 and D = E/(12(1-v^2))
# The analytical series solution converges to 2.998535904e-03 m
# when the first 16 terms of the series are considered (i.e., until
# m & n = 7).
