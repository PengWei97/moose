# Test for Pressure on shell elements
# An inclined cylindrical tank (length:3m) with a wall thickness of t=0.03 m and a radius of 0.5m is subjected to an internal presure of p=40 MPa.
# The lower part of the cylinder is constrained in all directions
# Theorically, assuming a thin_walled cylinder t/r <0.1, the hoop stress is sigma_t=p*r/t
# Therefore, in-plane force in the circumference of the cylinder is F=sigma_t*t= p*r=0.5*40=20 MN (independent of material properties of the shell)
# Analytical solution for the radial displacement : u=p*r^2/(E*t)=0.00167 m
# We check the axial_force_1 at the upper part of the cylinder (far from the lower boundary to avoid boundary effects)
# The numerical modeling results in axial_force_1 =19.882 MPa (0.6% error) and radial displacement u=0.00165 (1.1% error)
