# This model is a widely used benchmark model denoted the Scordelis-Lo roof.
# The maximum z-deformation is compared with the value given in "Proposed Standard Set of Problems to Test Finite Element Accuracy, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 1985".
# Based on the existing analytical Solutions, maximum deflection of the roof should be 0.3086
# The model results in a maximum deflection of 0.3090 (assuming a 15*15 structured mesh)
